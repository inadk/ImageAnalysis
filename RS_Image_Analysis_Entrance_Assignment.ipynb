    "Numpy (https://numpy.org/) is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions and pseudorandom number generators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different Python libraries can be used for basic image manipulation. Almost all of the libraries store an image in numpy ndarray (a 2-D array for grayscale and a 3-D array for an RGB image, for example). \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a solid understanding of numpy is necessary if you want to work on image analysis projects. In this course, we will mainly use the scikit-image package to build image analysis applications. This works heavily with numpy as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy provides the excellent ndarray objects, short for n-dimensional arrays. In a ‘ndarray’ object, aka ‘array’, you can store multiple items of the same data type. There are facilities around the array object that makes numpy so convenient for performing math and data manipulations.\n",
